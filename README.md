# Hi
I desided to implent all ways of the client Authentication for educational purposes.
Even though i dont do frontend i desided to make few simple pages(login,register,userProfile) for better understanding the auth flow and to not get lost in the future.

# Run Instructions 
<pre>
Run two folders concurrently:
Open the project --> cd client --> npm run dev

Run server:
Open the project --> cd server --> nodemon server.js

Run client:
Open the project --> cd client --> npm run build
</pre>

# Repo Structure
  <pre>
  Client folder - frontend part(Made on Svelte).
  Server folder - backend part(Node.js)
  </pre>
